    <p>
      <!-- Add your education, experience, or interests here -->
        My education is in ecology and biodiversity, a discipline that requires sharp attention to detail, and keen pattern recognition.
        My work experience has been in a variety of technical and educational roles. Most recently, I built a data stack from scratch in partnership
        with a data engineer.
        These days, I help data teams all over the world get up and running on dbt, helping them understand its best practices and establishing strong 
        analytics engineering practices on their data team.
